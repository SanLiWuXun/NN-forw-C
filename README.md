# NN-forw-C
***
&emsp;This project mainly forcus on the forward propagation using C language, while the training of the neural network is carried with other program, such as TensorFlow.
## fully-connected-dense
&emsp;In this case, the forward propagation is realized for a fully connected dense BP neural network, the output dimension is set to 1, and at the same time, the hidden layer dimensions are same (NumInOneLayer) for all hidden layers.
>Note: All the kernel and bias are imported from files.
